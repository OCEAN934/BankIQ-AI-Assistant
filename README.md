## Problem Statement

Financial and policy documents are often lengthy, complex, and difficult for customers to navigate.

Traditional keyword search fails to understand intent, context, and relationships between policy clauses.

BankIQ addresses this challenge by combining:

- Semantic Search
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Context-Aware Conversations
- Grounded Responses
- Source Attribution

to deliver accurate and explainable answers directly from uploaded documents.

---

### Semantic Retrieval using FAISS

Documents are:

1. Parsed
2. Chunked
3. Embedded
4. Indexed in FAISS

Relevant content is retrieved using vector similarity search.

---

### Cross-Encoder Reranking

Retrieved chunks are reranked using:

```text
cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2
```

This significantly improves retrieval precision and answer quality.

---

### Conversational AI Chat

Supports:

- Multi-turn conversations
- Context-aware follow-up questions
- Session memory

---

### Source Citations

Every response is grounded using retrieved document evidence.

Users can verify where information originated.

---

### Confidence Scoring

Each response includes:

- High Confidence
- Medium Confidence
- Low Confidence

based on supporting evidence available in retrieved sources.

---

### Intelligent Suggested Questions

The system automatically generates document-specific starter questions after upload.

Suggestions adapt dynamically to uploaded content.

---

### Hallucination Reduction

The assistant is explicitly constrained to:

- Use only retrieved context
- Avoid unsupported assumptions
- Indicate when information is unavailable
- Provide grounded reasoning
